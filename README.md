#PryLlama

Pryllama is a Pry session running in a Tmux session connected with Ollama functionality.

You can run any Ollama command within Pry and have the results both output and returned within the Pry session.

You can query the LLM automatically once you enter the Pry session, as well as change any of the parameters.

The pry session is bound within the PryllamaSession object itself that is created on startup.
