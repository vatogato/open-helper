Tmux sessions as interactive real time transformative code to natural language bindings.

Intent:  decoupling of informative input and output vis a vis 
its data layer || A brief but incredibly concise memoir detailing the craft
of slowly deforming the collective human sense of self:  an entreaty. part II, the sequel.


Tasks logic:

open tmux session, track name
set env vars based on config (per discrete functionality type)
attach and start pry
pry fires when_started hook, which
  adds our custom hooks and commands into Pry session
